# ssai-fcn

The models defined here work with the ssai code available here:
https://github.com/mitmul/ssai

The models defined here work with the modified branch of Caffe:
https://github.com/deepbasu007/caffe-fcn

The FCN and Deconvolutional Networks can be trained as standalone models from scratch or the Fully connected models can be transplanted to Fully Convolutional models using the net surgery trick.

The transplanted FCN can be used directly for prediction or can be re-trained using fine-tuning.
